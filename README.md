I was asked by [volant](https://twitter.com/volantmusic) to write a website/landing page for the newly releasing HYPERTRANCE vol.1.
In this project I explored dynamic content insertion, custom express webservers and lots of new corners of webdesign I hadn't experimented with previously.
I had a ton of fun making the website, and I hope you'll all have a ton of fun watching and listening to the crazy insane art this entire crew has produced.

# HYPERTRANCE vol.1

HYPERTRANCE is the definitive culmination of NEOY2K music and art.
This collective and collaborative project has been host to such creativity and persistence, and the pride associated with this volume is immense.
Over a period of 1 month, we created 20 pieces of music and 40 artworks, combining to an hour of live music entertainment.
